Graph Classification via Contrast Subgraphs

positional arguments:
  A_dir                 Filepath to class A directory containing brain network
                        files.
  B_dir                 Filepath to class B directory containing brain network
                        files.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a a, --alpha a       Penalty value for contrast subgraph size (varies from
                        0 to 1). If not provided, --tune-alpha is set to true.
  -a2 a, --alpha2 a     A secondary alpha value to use for the contrast
                        subgraph from B to A (only applies if problem
                        formulation is 1). Note that the original alpha is
                        used for both contrast subgraphs if this is not
                        provided.
  -t, --tune-alpha      Whether or not to tune the alpha hyperparameter(s)
                        before running the cross-validation (increases
                        runtime). Note that alpha is automatically tuned if no
                        alpha value is provided.
  -p {1,2}, --problem {1,2}
                        Problem Formulation (default: 1)
  -k NUM_FOLDS, --num-folds NUM_FOLDS
                        Number of times to fold data in k-fold cross
                        validation (default: 5).
  -s {qp,sdp}, --solver {qp,sdp}
                        Solver to use for finding a contrast subgraph
                        (default: sdp).
  -loo, --leave-one-out
                        If present, perform leave-one-out cross validation
                        (can be computationally expensive). This will cause
                        num-folds to be ignored.
  --plot                If present, plots will be generated in the ./plots/
                        directory.
  -pre PLOT_PREFIX, --plot-prefix PLOT_PREFIX
                        A string to prepend to plot names.
  -cs NUM_CONTRAST_SUBGRAPHS, --num-contrast-subgraphs NUM_CONTRAST_SUBGRAPHS
                        Number of non-overlapping contrast subgraphs to use
                        (default: 1). When a cs is found, its nodes are
                        removed from the difference network and the next cs is
                        found. At the end, the contrast subgraphs are
                        concatenated and used together.
