abstract = {Mining human-brain networks to discover patterns that can be used to discriminate between healthy individuals and patients affected by some neurological disorder, is a fundamental task in neuro-science. Learning simple and interpretable models is as important as mere classification accuracy. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for classifying brain networks based on extracting contrast subgraphs, i.e., a set of vertices whose induced subgraphs are dense in one class of graphs and sparse in the other. We formally define the problem and present an algorithmic solution for extracting contrast subgraphs. We then apply our method to a brain-network dataset consisting of children affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder and children Typically Developed. Our analysis confirms the interestingness of the discovered patterns, which match background knowledge in the neuro-science literature. Further analysis on other classification tasks confirm the simplicity, soundness, and high explainability of our proposal, which also exhibits superior classification accuracy, to more complex state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Given an n-vertex graph with nonnegative edge weights and a positive integer k≤n, our goal is to find a k-vertex subgraph with the maximum weight. We study the following greedy algorithm for this problem: repeatedly remove a vertex with the minimum weighted-degree in the currently remaining graph, until exactly k vertices are left. We derive tight bounds on the worst case approximation ratio R of this greedy algorithm: (1/2+n/2k)2−O(n−1/3)≤R≤(1/2+n/2k)2+O(1/n) for k in the range n/3≤k≤n and 2(n/k−1)−O(1/k)≤R≤2(n/k−1)+O(n/k2) for k<n/3. For k=n/2, for example, these bounds are 9/4±O(1/n), improving on naive lower and upper bounds of 2 and 4, respectively. The upper bound for general k compares well with currently the best (and much more complicated) approximation algorithm based on semidefinite programming.}

abstract = {Finding dense subgraphs is an important graph-mining task with many applications. Given that the direct optimization of edge density is not meaningful, as even a single edge achieves maximum density, research has focused on optimizing alternative density functions. A very popular among such functions is the average degree, whose maximization leads to the well-known densest-subgraph notion. Surprisingly enough, however, densest subgraphs are typically large graphs, with small edge density and large diameter.In this paper, we define a novel density function, which gives subgraphs of much higher quality than densest subgraphs: the graphs found by our method are compact, dense, and with smaller diameter. We show that the proposed function can be derived from a general framework, which includes other important density functions as subcases and for which we show interesting general theoretical properties. To optimize the proposed function we provide an additive approximation algorithm and a local-search heuristic. Both algorithms are very efficient and scale well to large graphs.We evaluate our algorithms on real and synthetic datasets, and we also devise several application studies as variants of our original problem. When compared with the method that finds the subgraph of the largest average degree, our algorithms return denser subgraphs with smaller diameter. Finally, we discuss new interesting research directions that our problem leaves open.},
