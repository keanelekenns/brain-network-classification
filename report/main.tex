\title{Explaining Models for Brain Network Classification}

\section{Introduction}

There are a number of different areas we could focus on:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Autism Spectrum Disorder and its impact
    \item Model Explainability and Interpretability (explainable models vs explanation techniques for black box models)
\end{enumerate}


Contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Replication of Lanciano et al \cite{lanciano2020} + replication package
    \item Improvements to Lanciano et al's technique + discriminative edges technique + graph embedding evaluation module
    \item Using black box models on dataset (DNN and GNN)
    \item Investigate explanation techniques for black box models
\end{enumerate}
  
\section{Related Work}
\textbf{I think we need to spend a lot of time here. Looking at the manuscripts page, I am overwhelmed and feel that we have not adequately made ourselves aware of the existing work in the field. I do not feel confident saying our work is novel...}

Manuscripts page: http://fcon\_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/manuscripts.html

Talk about the shortcomings of the work from lanciano here \cite{lanciano2020}?

\section{Problem Statement}
Not sure exactly where we are focusing our problem. Here are some options:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Creating explainable models (node identity aware data)
    \item Exploring explanation techniques for black box models (node identity aware data) 
    \item Brain network classification
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data}
\textbf{We need to do more research on the dataset and consider using the ABIDE II dataset instead of just ABIDE I. It looks like only ABIDE I has been preprocessed from the link below, but perhaps someone has preprocessed ABIDE II in a similar fashion.}

\textbf{Discussion of Node-Identity Awareness and its importance with respect to how we treat the data. We do not need to treat it strictly like a graph as lanciano et al do.}

\section{Experiments}

\section{Discussion}

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider spaciality of ROIs.
    \item Consider different preprocessing of ABIDE dataset.
    \item Run experiments with ABIDE II (if we don't get to it)
\end{itemize}
